About
=====

Zorin Menu Lite is the default application launcher in Zorin OS Lite. 
When you open it you are shown a list of categories for the installed apps.
You can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on
the category buttons. Top level categories make browsing fast,
and simple to switch between.

If you're not sure exactly where a program is listed, instead of browsing
through each category you can simply enter a search term. The search
field is focused when opening the menu, so you can just start typing.
Application descriptions as well as names are searched, which allows you
to find a program by using a general word (such as "browser" to find all
web browsers installed on your computer).


Keyboard Shortcut
=================

A script to open and close Zorin Menu Lite from the keyboard is included.
To enable support, open the keyboard preferences
['All Settings' -> 'Keyboard' -> 'Application Shortcuts']. Add a shortcut
for the command 'xfce4-popup-zorinmenulite' and bind it to the keyboard
shortcut of your choice.


Compiz Workaround
=================

To allow Zorin Menu Lite to focus the search field when shown under compiz
you will need to add it to the list of windows ignored by compiz's keyboard
focus prevention. Open the focus prevention of the compiz settings
manager [ccsm -> 'General Settings' -> 'Focus Prevention'].
Add (title="Zorin Menu Lite") to the exclude pattern to make compiz ignore
Zorin Menu Lite and allow it to focus when shown.
